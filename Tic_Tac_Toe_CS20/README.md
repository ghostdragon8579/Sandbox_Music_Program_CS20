A matrix array also known as a 2D array is a method that is used to store data in a grid format
through rows and columns. Matrix arrays are arrays of arrays with every element in a matrix array
being an array itself. These elements are accessed using a format that pulls from a specified row 
and column. This format is used for many things grids and game boards for example. In the first
matrix array it is being used to detrmine if the respective player or computer has won. By checking if three 
consecutive spaces are claimed by one side. The other matrix array is setup identically however it's 
purpose is to allow the computer to check if the player has claimed two consecutive spaces and make a move to
prevent the player from winning with their next move.
