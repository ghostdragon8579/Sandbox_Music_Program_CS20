         <ln style="font-size:1.2vw"> My name is Eric Barnes.</ln>
         <ln style="font-size:1.2vw"> I am currently a student at <a target="_blank" href="https://queenelizabeth.epsb.ca/"><strong> Queen Elizabeth high school.</a></ln></strong>
         <ln style="font-size:1.2vw"> I enjoy computer programing and have created several different programs and futher develop these programs in both school and in my free time.</ln>
         <ln style="font-size:1.2vw"> I like Dungeons and Dragons and several of the features in the design of this webpage were inspired from expereinces in the game.</ln>

      <h3>Details about the program:</h3>
        <p>
         <ln style="font-size:1.2vw"> This is a free-to-use music program designed and published for CS20. (Computer Science 20-1)</ln>
         <ln style="font-size:1.2vw"> It was made as a more advanced replacment for the music program I developed in CS10 (Computer Science 10-1)</ln>
         <ln style="font-size:1.2vw"> It contains the a few songs paired with images that are designed to accurately depict the music that is currently selected</ln>
         <ln style="font-size:1.2vw"> It also contains a progress indicator for the music that is selected along with various buttons to skip, rewind, and pause the selected music.</ln>

    <div> 
      <p style="font-size:1.5vw">This is a rough draft of the design that will be used in the music player created for CS20. 
        <ln style="font-size:1.5vw">The focus of the design is to create a simple interface that is easy to learn how to use.</ln>
        <ln style="font-size:1.5vw">The following is a summary of the design's various buttons and their purposes:</ln>
         <li style="font-size:1.2vw"> The button on the far left skips to the previous song in the playlist.</li>
         <li style="font-size:1.2vw"> The button second from the left rewinds the selected song by ten seconds.</li>
         <li style="font-size:1.2vw"> The middle button plays the selected song however if the song is already playing it pauses the song instead.</li>
         <li style="font-size:1.2vw"> The button second from the right skips ten seconds ahead in the selected song.</li>
         <li style="font-size:1.2vw"> The button on the far right skips to the next song in the playlist.</li>
         <li style="font-size:1.2vw"> The button with an X on it in the top right of the design quits the program.</li>

        <ln style="font-size:1.3vw"> The first of the following videos accurately represents the kind of background music I imagine this music player would be used for.</ln>
        <ln style="font-size:1.3vw"> However due the music that is played is entirely dependent on the user something more like the second video displays may be played instead. </ln>
