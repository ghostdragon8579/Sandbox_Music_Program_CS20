         <ln> I enjoy computer programing and have created several different programs and futher develop these programs in both school and in my free time.</ln>
         <ln> I like Dungeons and Dragons and several of the features in the design of this webpage were inspired from expereinces in the game.</ln>

         <ln> This is a free-to-use music program designed and published for CS20. (Computer Science 20-1)</ln>
         <ln> It was made as a more advanced replacment for the music program I developed in CS10 (Computer Science 10-1)</ln>
         <ln> It contains a few songs paired with images that are designed to accurately depict the music that is currently selected</ln>
         <ln> It also contains a progress indicator for the music that is selected along with various buttons to skip, rewind, and pause the selected music.</ln>

      <p>This is a rough draft of the design that will be used in the music player created for CS20. The focus of the design is to create a simple interface that is easy to learn how to use. The following is a summary of the design's various buttons and their purposes:
         <li> The button on the far left skips to the previous song in the playlist.</li>
         <li> The button second from the left rewinds the selected song by ten seconds.</li>
         <li> The middle button plays the selected song however if the song is already playing it pauses the song instead.</li>
         <li> The button second from the right skips ten seconds ahead in the selected song.</li>
         <li> The button on the far right skips to the next song in the playlist.</li>
         <li> The button with an X on it in the top right of the design quits the program.</li>

    </div>
    <div>
      <p>This is the color scheme that will be used in the music player created for CS20. The colors are designed to be noticeable and visually appealing. The following is a description of the various aspects of the color scheme:
        <li> The overall theme is going to be a neon design mainly made up of purple and black.</li>
        <li> The background of the music player will be neon purple border.</li>
        <li> The text that will be used in the music player will the same color as the border.</li>
        <li> The buttons that will be used to manipulate the music that is selected will be an combination of black and neon white.</li>
        <li> However the exit button will not follow this color scheme with the colors composing it being red and black.</li>

        <ln> The music player is designed to be used to play background music while the user is doing something else.</ln>
        <ln> The first of the presented videos accurately represents the kind of background music I imagine this music player would be used for.</ln>
        <ln> However due the music that is played is entirely dependent on the user something more like the second video displays may be played instead. </ln>
